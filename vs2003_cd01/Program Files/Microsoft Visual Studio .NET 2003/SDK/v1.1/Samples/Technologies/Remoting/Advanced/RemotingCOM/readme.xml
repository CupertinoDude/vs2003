<title> Remoting COM Sample</title>

<title-short>Using COM with .NET remoting</title-short>

<overview> 
This sample shows how to use remoting with COM by providing the MediaPlayer
as a service to remoting clients.  When PT (Play Title) is selected on the client,
the sample will play an audio as well as a video clip.  This sample assumes you have
multimedia installed in Windows and that this service is working properly. This
sample does not close the Media Player automatically, you have to do that
manually after running the sample.
