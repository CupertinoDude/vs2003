    Overview
    </h4><p class="Text"> 
This sample shows how to use events in .NET Remoting.  We host two remote objects
using two different console applications.  One of these remote objects, Waz, exposes
a method called HelloMethod that clients can call.  When this method is called, it
checks if any event handlers have been registered and then fires an event on the 
handler.  The other object, Baz, exposes a method called GreetingHandler that
will be called when the event is fired. This sample also has two clients, one in RemotingEvents/Client and one in RemotingEvents/EventRegistration.  The client in the Client directory activates a remote Waz object and calls the HelloMethod a few times.  Since no handlers have been registered with Waz, no events will be fired.  The client in RemotingEvents/EventRegistration activates 2 remote objects, a Waz as well as a Baz.  It registers a GreetingEvent handler with Waz, providing the GreetingHandler method on the Baz object as the callback.  When the client now calls the HelloMethod on Waz, an event is fired and the handler on Baz will be called.  You should see Baz printing a message from the greeting handler in its console window and Waz printing a notice that the event was fired.

    Building the Sample
    </h4><p class="Text">
    In order to properly build and run this sample, the following steps need to be performed.
    </p><p class="Text"> 
Type <b>nmake -a all</b> from the command line in the RemotingEvents directory.

<p class="FixedHeading">
  For Example:
  </p><p class="FixedText"> 
C:\Program Files\Microsoft.NET\SDK\v1.1\Samples\Technologies\Remoting\Basic\RemotingEvents&gt; nmake -a all

    Running the Sample
    </h4><p class="Text">
    In order to run this sample, follow the instructions listed below.
    </p><span class="Text"><ul class="Text"><li>
Start the EventFire host by running EventFireHost.exe from the EventFire directory.
Run the client by executing Client.exe in the Client directory.
</li></ul><ul class="Text"><li>
Start the EventSink host by running EventSinkHost.exe from the EventSink directory.  
Ensure that the EventFire host is running as well.  Run the client by executing
EventRegistration.exe in the EventRegistration directory.
</li></ul></span><p class="SectionBreak" /><h4 class="Heading"><a name="_sdkvars" />
    Notes
    </h4><p class="Text">
    For the .Net Framework samples to function properly, your Path, Include, and Lib environment variables must be set correctly. 
    In many cases, the SDK install program updates these environment variables for you. However, if you installed the .Net Framework SDK 
    using Visual Studio .NET, or unselected "register environment variables" during setup, these environment variables will not be updated. 
    You can set the Path, Include and Lib environment variables by running SDKVars.bat, located in the <i>&lt;SDKRoot&gt;\Bin</i> directory. 
    SDKVars.bat must be executed in every command shell.
