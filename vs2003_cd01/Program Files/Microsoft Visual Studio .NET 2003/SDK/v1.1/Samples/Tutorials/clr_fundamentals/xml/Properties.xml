	<Paragraph>
		The CLR offers "smart" fields called properties. Properties allow a type to expose its fields while ensuring that the fields are always manipulated in a safe, consistent way so that the object's 			state never becomes corrupted. The nice thing about properties is that code to access a property is identical in syntax to code that accesses a field. Under the covers, the compiler generates 		code to call a method that performs additional logic.
