<Document Title="Constant Fields and Read-Only Fields">
	<Paragraph>
		Constant fields identify fields whose value is determined at compile time. In C#, constants are always considered to be static. That is, a constant cannot be initialized to the result of calling some 		runtime method or function.
	</Paragraph>
	<Paragraph>
		Read-only fields identify fields whose value is determined when an object is constructed. So read-only fields are set during object construction and no other method can change the value of a 		read-only field.	
	</Paragraph>
	<Paragraph>
		The code below demonstrates how to create and use constant and read-only fields.
