<H1>MYC Langauge Specification</H1>
<H3>Goals</H3>
The goal of the MYC compiler is to show MSIL instructions and the 
EE in action. 
<H3>Overview </H3>
The compiler itself is a simple recursive descent parser with 
a single pass code generator. It generates an assembler source file which is 
then used as input to the MSIL Assembler (ILASM.EXE). 
<H3>Language Specification </H3>
The language is a subset of the C language with 
simplified declarations, both external and local. 
<H3>Data Types </H3>
The only supported data types are "int" and "void". Limiting 
these choices (for now) allows a simpler compiler design. 
<H3>Data Declaration </H3>
Variables can be declared "static" or local. Implicit 
"static" declarations occur outside of function declarations. Local declarations 
can occur only at the beginnings of functions prior to statements.
<B>For example:</B>
<PRE>
int foo()
  {
  int y;
  }
int x;

int bar()
  {
  static int z;
  };
</PRE>
<P>
In this example the variable "x" is a static declaration (by default) and the 
variable "y" is a local variable in function "foo". The variable
"z" is actually a static even though it is declared within a function.
