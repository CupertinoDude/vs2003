<span class="header">Welcome to the ASP.NET QuickStart Tutorial</span>
<p>
The ASP.NET QuickStart is a series of ASP.NET samples and supporting commentary designed to quickly acquaint developers with the syntax, architecture, and power of the ASP.NET Web programming framework. The QuickStart samples are designed to be short, easy-to-understand illustrations of ASP.NET features.  By the time you have completed the QuickStart tutorial, you will be familiar with:
<ul>
<li><b>ASP.NET Syntax.</b> While some of the ASP.NET syntax elements will be familiar to veteran ASP developers, several are unique to the new framework.  The QuickStart samples cover each element in detail.
<li><b>ASP.NET Architecture and Features.</b> The QuickStart introduces the features of ASP.NET that enable developers to build interactive, world-class applications with much less time and effort than ever before.
<li><b>Best Practices.</b> The QuickStart samples demonstrate the best ways to exercise the power of ASP.NET while avoiding potential pitfalls along the way.
</ul>

<span class="caption">What Level of Expertise Is Assumed in the QuickStart?</span><br>
If you have never developed Web pages before, the QuickStart is not for you. You should be fluent in HTML and general Web development terminology. You do not need previous ASP experience, but you should be familiar with the concepts behind interactive Web pages, including forms, scripts, and data access.
<p>
<span class="caption">Working with the QuickStart Samples</span><br>
The QuickStart samples are best experienced in the order in which they are presented. Each sample builds on concepts discussed in the preceding sample. The sequence begins with a simple form submittal and builds up to integrated application scenarios.
