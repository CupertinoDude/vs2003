<span class="header">What is ASP.NET?</span>

<p>ASP.NET is a programming framework built on the common language runtime that can be used on a server to build 
powerful Web applications. ASP.NET offers several important advantages over previous Web development 
models:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Enhanced Performance.</b> ASP.NET is compiled common language runtime code running on the server. Unlike 
    its interpreted predecessors, ASP.NET can take advantage of early binding, just-in-time 
    compilation, native optimization, and caching services right out of the box. This amounts to dramatically better performance before you ever write a line of 
    code.<br /><br />

  <li><b>World-Class Tool Support.</b> The ASP.NET framework is complemented by a rich toolbox and 
    designer in the Visual Studio integrated development environment. WYSIWYG editing, drag-and-drop 
    server controls, and automatic deployment are just a few of the features this powerful tool 
    provides.<br /><br />

  <li><b>Power and Flexibility.</b> Because ASP.NET is based on the common language runtime, the power and 
    flexibility of that entire platform is available to Web application developers. The .NET Framework class library, Messaging, and Data Access solutions are all seamlessly 
    accessible from the Web. ASP.NET is also language-independent, so you can choose the language 
    that best applies to your application or partition your application across many languages. 
    Further, common language runtime interoperability guarantees that your existing investment in 
    COM-based development is preserved when migrating to ASP.NET.<br /><br />

  <li><b>Simplicity.</b> ASP.NET makes it easy to perform common tasks, from simple form submission 
    and client authentication to deployment and site configuration. For example, the ASP.NET page 
    framework allows you to build user interfaces that cleanly separate application logic from 
    presentation code and to handle events in a simple, Visual Basic - like forms processing model. 
    Additionally, the common language runtime simplifies development, with managed code services such as
    automatic reference counting and garbage collection.<br /><br />

  <li><b>Manageability.</b> ASP.NET employs a text-based, hierarchical configuration system, which 
    simplifies applying settings to your server environment and Web applications. Because 
    configuration information is stored as plain text, new settings may be applied without the 
    aid of local administration tools. This "zero local administration" philosophy extends to 
    deploying ASP.NET Framework applications as well. An ASP.NET Framework application is deployed to a server simply by 
    copying the necessary files to the server. No server restart is required, even to deploy or 
    replace running compiled code.<br /><br />

  <li><b>Scalability and Availability.</b> ASP.NET has been designed with scalability in mind, with 
    features specifically tailored to improve performance in clustered and multiprocessor 
    environments. Further, processes are closely monitored and managed by the ASP.NET runtime, so 
    that if one misbehaves (leaks, deadlocks), a new process can be created in its place, which 
    helps keep your application constantly available to handle requests.<br /><br />

  <li><b>Customizability and Extensibility.</b> ASP.NET delivers a well-factored architecture that 
    allows developers to "plug-in" their code at the appropriate level. In fact, it is possible to 
    extend or replace any subcomponent of the ASP.NET runtime with your own custom-written component. 
    Implementing custom authentication or state services has never been easier.<br /><br />

  <li><b>Security.</b> With built in Windows authentication and per-application configuration, 
    you can be assured that your applications are secure.

</ul>

<p>The remainder of the QuickStart presents practical examples of these concepts.</p>
