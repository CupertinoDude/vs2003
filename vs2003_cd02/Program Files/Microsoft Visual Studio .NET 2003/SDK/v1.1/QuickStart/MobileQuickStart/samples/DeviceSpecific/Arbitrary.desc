Inserting Arbitrary Content
This sample demonstrates how to use a ContentTemplate template in 
a Panel mobile control to insert arbitrary device-specific markup
into a page. On HTML devices, the panel in this form emits custom
HTML markup. On other devices, they render the panel's 
ordinary contents.
