A Templated List
This sample demonstrates how to use a Template Set to customize a 
List Mobile control. When an HTML device requests this page,
the list is rendered using the templates defined on the page. For
other devices, the list uses its default rendering. 
<p>
The list always uses the <b>OnItemCommand</b> event to report user interaction, 
whether directly for its default rendering or by bubbling the event on the
LinkButton Web Forms control in the template.
