Paginating a List
This sample demonstrates how to make use of the automatic pagination
features in a form containing a List mobile control. The sample 
programatically fills the list with all prime numbers lower than 500. 
Because the form's <b>Paginate</b> property has been set to True, 
the form is automatically paginated according to the target device.
