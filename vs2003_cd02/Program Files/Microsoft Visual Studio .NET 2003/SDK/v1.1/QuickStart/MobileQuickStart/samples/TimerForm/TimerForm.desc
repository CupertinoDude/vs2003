Timer Form
This sample shows a complex control that inherits from Form, and
provides the ability to raise events or perform other actions
after a given timer interval. The control includes its own
device adapters, that customize the behavior of existing Form
device adapters.  Client-side markup is used to cause the browser to perform
the desired timed action.  Note that the device adapters are specified in the
web.config files.
