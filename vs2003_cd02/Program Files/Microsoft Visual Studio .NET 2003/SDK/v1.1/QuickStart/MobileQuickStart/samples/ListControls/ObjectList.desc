Object Lists
This sample demonstrates how to use the ObjectList mobile control. It shows how you
can databind a collection of objects to an ObjectList; how you can define fields to 
be bound and shown for each object, using the <b>&lt;Field&gt;</b> element; 
and how you can define commands that the user can select for an object, using 
the <b>&lt;Command&gt;</b> element. It also shows how you can access field values
for an individual item at runtime.
