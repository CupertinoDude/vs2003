Template Sets in Stylesheets
This sample demonstrates how you can use a Style element in a 
Stylesheet to define template sets. The sample defines the
form template sets in a single style, and refers to the style
from more than one form using the <b>StyleReference</b> property.
The style also includes ordinary style properties.
