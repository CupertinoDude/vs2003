Displaying Images
This sample demonstrates how you can specify a set of images from which
one will be selected based upon the characteristics of the display device.
In this case, if the preferred image type is BMP (as is the case on 
Openwave.com 3.x browser), a BMP image is provided.  Similar checks are made for
WBMP (preferred on other WML browsers), and PNG.  Otherwise,
a GIF image is provided.
