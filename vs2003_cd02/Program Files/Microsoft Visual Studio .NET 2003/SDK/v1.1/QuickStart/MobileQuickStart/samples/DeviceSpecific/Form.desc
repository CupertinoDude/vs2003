A Templated Form
This sample demonstrates how to use a Template Set to customize a
Form mobile control. When an HTML device requests this page,
the forms is rendered with the header and footer defined in the 
HTML-specific template set. For other devices, the form uses
the header defined in the device-independent template set.
