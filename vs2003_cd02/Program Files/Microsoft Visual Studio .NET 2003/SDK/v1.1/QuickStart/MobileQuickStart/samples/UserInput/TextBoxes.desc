User Input on a Mobile Web Form
This sample demonstrates how to accept numeric and password input using 
the TextBox mobile control. 
Because the first Textbox is numeric, some devices will limit input to
numeric data. For other devices, validation must be done on the server.
The first form on this page contains multiple
input controls, and may be paginated differently according to the target device.
