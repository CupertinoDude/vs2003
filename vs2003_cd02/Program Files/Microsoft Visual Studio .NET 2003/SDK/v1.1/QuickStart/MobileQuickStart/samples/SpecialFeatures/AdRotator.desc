Using the AdRotator
This sample demonstrates how you can get the equivalent of the ASP.NET AdRotator
control for use on mobile devices.  The mobile version of the AdRotator differs from
the desktop version in that a separate <b>ImageKey</b> attribute may be specified for
different preferred image formats, allowing the same advertisement file to be used
across multiple image formats.
