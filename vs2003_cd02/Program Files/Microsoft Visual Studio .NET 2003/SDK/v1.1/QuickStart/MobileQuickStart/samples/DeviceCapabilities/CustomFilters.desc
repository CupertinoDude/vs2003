Custom Device Filters
This sample shows you how to create your own custom device filters,
and provides a useful gallery of custom filters.
An application page can then use the filters in a &lt;Choice&gt;
tag, or programmatically as shown here.  Note that the
<b>web.config</b> that associates the filters with code is
available to be viewed as part of the source.
