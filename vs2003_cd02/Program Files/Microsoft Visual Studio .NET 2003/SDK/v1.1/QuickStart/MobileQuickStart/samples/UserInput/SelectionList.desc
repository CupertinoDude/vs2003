Using a SelectionList
This sample demonstrates how to use a SelectionList control
to allow the user to choose between several options as part of an input form.
The sample also shows how the Label controls on the second form
use declarative data binding (with the <b>&lt;%# #&gt;</b>) syntax to 
display dynamic data.
