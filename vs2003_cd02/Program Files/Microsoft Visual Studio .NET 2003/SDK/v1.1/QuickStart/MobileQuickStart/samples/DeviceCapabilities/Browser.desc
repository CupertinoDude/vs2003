Mobile Capabilities
This sample shows you the properties available to you from
the <b>MobileCapabilities</b> object. The sample uses reflection
to fill a List mobile control with all the public properties available,
and allows you to view the value of a property using the 
<b>DataBinder.Eval</b> technique of data binding.
