Object List Context Menus
This sample demonstrates how you can handle the <b>OnShowItemCommands</b> event
of an ObjectList mobile control to alter the set of commands available for 
a given item. This sample is identical to the earlier object list sample, 
except that wherever a city has a weather map available, this event handler 
adds an extra command to the list of commands.
