Using Inheritance
This sample illustrates how to use inheritance to build 
custom behavior on top of an existing mobile control. The control 
shown here inherits from the List mobile control to create a
menu. The menu is automatically generated from other forms in the
page, and provides its own command handling, navigating to the 
selected form.
