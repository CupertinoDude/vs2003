Applying Style Properties
This sample demonstrates how you can use style properties such as 
<b>FontName</b>, <b>FontSize</b>, <b>ForeColor</b>, and <b>BackColor</b>
to enhance rendering where supported on the target device.
This sample is similar to the "Responding To Control Events" sample
in an earlier section, but the first form now has color properties defined,
and the contents have font properties defined.
