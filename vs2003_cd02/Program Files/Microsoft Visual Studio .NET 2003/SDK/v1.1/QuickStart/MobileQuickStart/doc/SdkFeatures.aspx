<h4>ASP.NET Mobile Controls</h4>

Microsoft ASP.NET enables you to easily build powerful Web applications that 
target mobile devices, from cell phones to personal digital assistants.
With ASP.NET, designing and writing mobile Web Forms is quick and efficient. 

<P>

ASP.NET mobile controls are built on the Microsoft .NET Framework, 
and brings all the advantages of the Microsoft ASP.NET Web development model to 
the world of mobile Web applications.
In addition, ASP.NET mobile controls offer the following features:

<ul>

<li><b>Support for a variety of devices</b>. 
ASP.NET enables you to target 
a wide variety of mobile devices, from WML-based cell phones 
to the HTML-based Pocket PC.

<br><br>

<li><b>Write-once Web pages</b>.
ASP.NET provides a set of adaptive components that
allow you to author a Web application once, and display that same application on
any supported mobile device without further tweaking.
You can write complex applications by using a 
set of mobile server controls, with no required knowledge of WML or other
markup languages. ASP.NET even takes care of many of the implementation
differences among browsers, devices, and gateways.

<br><br>

<li><b>World-class tool support</b>.
ASP.NET mobile controls are integrated with the
Microsoft Visual Studio .NET version 7.0 IDE,
with its rich toolbox and designer,
drag-and-drop server control support, automatic deployment, and a host of other
features.

<br><br>

<li><b>Customizability and extensibility</b>.
ASP.NET mobile controls provide the same customization and extensibility 
features as ASP.NET. In addition, the mobile controls provide an extensibility model that
allows support for other devices to be added, without requiring changes to 
application code.
This ensures that the mobile Web applications you write today will 
be able to support new generations of devices in the future.
