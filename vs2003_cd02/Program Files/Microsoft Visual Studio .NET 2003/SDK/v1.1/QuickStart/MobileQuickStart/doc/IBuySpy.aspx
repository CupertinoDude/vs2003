<h4>IBuySpy Mobile Portal</h4>

<p>

The <a target="_new" href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=5809">IBuySpy Developer Solution Kits</a>
demonstrates how you can use
Microsoft ASP.NET and the Microsoft .NET Framework to build either an intranet or Internet
portal application. IBuySpy Portal offers all the functionality of
typical portal applications, including:

<ul>
  <li>Ten basic portal modules for common types of content</li>
  <li>A "pluggable" framework that is simple to extend with custom portal modules</li> 
  <li>Online administration of portal layout, content, and security</li> 
  <li>Roles-based security for viewing content, editing content, and administering the portal</li>
</ul>

All code contained in the IBuySpy Portal download package is free for use in your
own applications. But if you prefer, you can customize the portal for your own
use without writing a line of code. The portal includes built-in administration
pages for setting up your portal, adding content, and setting security options.
 
<p>

In addition, the IBuySpy Portal contains a number of modules that have
been developed with ASP.NET mobile controls, providing portal
functionality to mobile devices. In fact, visiting the
<a target="_new" href="http://www.ibuyspyportal.com">IBuySpy Portal</a>
with an ASP.NET–supported mobile device will present the mobile version
of the portal.
