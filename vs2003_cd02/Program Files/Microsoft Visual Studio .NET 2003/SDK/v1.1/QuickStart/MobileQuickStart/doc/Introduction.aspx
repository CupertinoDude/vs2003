<h4>Welcome to the Microsoft ASP.NET Mobile Controls QuickStart Tutorial</h4>

The Microsoft ASP.NET Mobile Controls QuickStart is a series of samples and supporting commentary designed 
to quickly acquaint you with mobile Web applications.
The QuickStart samples are designed to be short, easy-to-understand illustrations of 
features of the ASP.NET mobile controls. By the time you complete the QuickStart tutorial, you will be 
able to build fully functioning mobile Web applications.<p>

<span class="caption">What Level of Expertise Is Assumed in the QuickStart?</span><br>
ASP.NET mobile controls are built on the ASP.NET Web Forms architecture. 
Before you begin, familiarize yourself with writing ASP.NET Web Forms applications by 
completing the
<a href="/quickstart/aspplus" target="_top">ASP.NET QuickStart tutorial</a>.
Note that this tutorial is available only if you have installed the Microsoft .NET Framework samples.

<p>

<span class="caption">Working with the QuickStart Samples</span><br>
The QuickStart samples are best experienced in the presented sequence. Each section assumes that
you are familiar with concepts presented in earlier sections.

<p>

<span class="caption">Rebuilding the Supporting Assemblies</span><br>
There are a number of individual assemblies included with the QuickStarts that correspond to
source code in the QuickStart samples. To encourage experimentation, a batch file is provided to allow
these assemblies to be rebuilt.  The batch file is called <b>qsmake.bat</b> and is located in the <b>samples</b>
directory of the QuickStart distribution.  Running this batch file recompiles and overwrites the assemblies
in the <b>bin</b> directory of the QuickStart distribution.

<p>

<span class="caption">Using the QuickStart Samples in Visual Studio .NET</span><br>
The QuickStart samples do not require Visual Studio .NET and the ASP.NET mobile designer,
and are not written to work in that environment without modification.
