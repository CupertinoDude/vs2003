<h4>Fitch and Mather Expense Reporting</h4>

<p>

The Fitch and Mather Expense Reporting application (FMExpense) is a Web application 
designed for the hypothetical Fitch and Mather Corporation.
Employees of the corporation can complete, submit, and approve expense reports using a Web
browser to access the application. 

<p>

FMExpense adds a convenient expense
recording feature that is based on the Microsoft ASP.NET page framework.
Using a mobile device, employees can record an
expense in a report when it occurs. For example, after
dinner at a restaurant, the employee can use a mobile device to add
the expense report information.
Later, when the employee uses the desktop browser to
edit the report, the recorded expenses are automatically included.
The employee can complete and submit the report.
