\par }{\b\f28\fs16 Zinda:}{\f28\fs16  The ASP.NET Web Forms feature is really a Visual Basic-like page-and-control framework that you can use to build Web pages. It's a new feature in Vis
ual Studio.NET. It gets developers out of the business of having to litter their HTML with server-side code. Just like current versions of Visual Basic, it lets you break your code into a template, which is the UI, and a class file -- the code that you ac
tually write to program to the UI.
\par }{\b\f28\fs16 MSDN Online:}{\f28\fs16  Why should developers be excited about this?
\par }{\b\f28\fs16 Zinda:}{\f28\fs16  There are three big things that developers are going to be excited about with Web Forms: performance, scalability, and productivity. As far as performance, w
e've spent an enormous amount of time on ASP.NET (which is the next version of ASP that Web Forms is a part of), making sure that we've learned the lessons from ASP and every other lesson we could learn around here about how to make applications scalable.

\par For example, instead of having interpreted script, we've actually provided the ability for compiled code to run through your pages. We've added the ability to fire asynchronous methods, so that your server isn't blocked waiting for a method call to return
 and can actually process other requests.
\par For scalability, we've also added the ability to support state across a Web farm, so you\rquote re no longer blocked into using a single front end for your Web pages or rolling your own state management across a bunch of front-end servers.
\par For productivity, we've added an enormous amount of features. The first one is what I just talked about: The fact that you no longer have to embed your server script in your HTML, which is hard to maintain and difficult to do. Instead,
 we've allowed you to take your HTML page, drag and drop controls onto it, and focus on the code you want to write -- the functionality in the application as opposed to what actual pieces of text get spit out into the HTML.
\par }{\b\f28\fs16 MSDN Online:}{\f28\fs16  You sound like a technical guy. You're not a marketing person, right?
\par }{\b\f28\fs16 Zinda:}{\f28\fs16  No, I'm not. I swear I\rquote m not a marketing person.
\par }{\b\f28\fs16 MSDN Online:}{\f28\fs16  Did you lead the development of Web Forms?
\par }{\b\f28\fs16 Zinda:}{\f28\fs16  Yeah, I've been here for a little while running the Web Forms development and various other things we\rquote re working on in Visual Studio .NET.
\par }{\b\f28\fs16 MSDN Online:}{\f28\fs16  Have you done a lot of development yourself?

, formerly known as the Investor Team. So I've had a bunch of experience running a real Web site and have tried to bring the lessons that I've learned there to bear on the development of this control set.
\par }{\b\f28\fs16 MSDN Online:}{\f28\fs16  How should developers prepare for Web Forms?
\par }{\b\f28\fs16 Zinda:}{\f28\fs16
 The standard best practices are probably the best ways to prepare. So, things like taking your business rules and encapsulating them in COM objects, and using ASP as a way to present the UI, calling out your business rules. Those are prob
ably the best ways I could say for how to prepare, and they\rquote re standard things that you want to do anyway when building a Web site.
\par }{\b\f28\fs16 MSDN Online:}{\f28\fs16  Can you talk a little bit about the learning curve? I'm sure there are some developers reading this and saying, "Oh no, I\rquote ve got to learn something new from Microsoft again."
\par }{\b\f28\fs16 Zinda:}{\f28\fs16  What we've tried to do is build a very Visual Basic-like model, so a developer who has built forms in Visual Basic will be able to get a running start at building Web pages just because
 the model is very much the same. They're going to bring up a page, drag out some controls, hook up code to the events, and program the controls with properties and methods.
\par The biggest learning curve is imposed by the Web itself. For example, there's a l
ong distance and often a slow connection between the time you hit a button and the time your server gets to process it. So you're not going to want to hook up event code that makes a lot of round trips to the server. That's kind of a new concept that you
never really had to think about in Visual Basic. But if you know Visual Basic, you should have a very good start at learning how to use this control framework.
\par }{\b\f28\fs16 MSDN Online:}{\f28\fs16  Microsoft's starting to talk about something called Web services. How do Web Forms relate to Web services?
\par }{\b\f28\fs16 Zinda:}{\f28\fs16  A Web service is basically an HTTP-addressable method call that can perform some action or return some data to the caller. We're doing two things in visual basic.net to help people build Web services.
\par First of all, Web Forms can call Web services to get something done. So you could build a Web form that has a button. When you click the button, the Web form gets an event , and it can call into a Web service to post data to your order-processing service,
 for example. In addition, we make it really easy to build the Web service itself. The idea of having a HTTP-addressable method is actually baked into ASP.NET. It's part of the system now.
\par }{\b\f28\fs16 MSDN Online:}{\f28\fs16  What about my existing Web classes? What happens to those, and what about my existing ASP applications? Do I have to rewrite those?
\par }{\b\f28\fs16 Zinda:}{\f28\fs16  Existing ASP applications will run without modification in ASP.NET. It really is the next version of ASP, and the whole idea behind Web classes is that of having an ASP-add
ressable method that runs compiled code. We've taken that technology and actually built it into the system, so that now you don\rquote
t have to use a separate tool or technology to build that kind of functionality. Using Visual Basic and ASP.NET, you'll be able to build the exact functionality that you could have built using Web classes.
\par }{\b\f28\fs16 MSDN Online:}{\f28\fs16  Are there any other Web-editing innovations you can talk about that are coming in the next version of Visual Basic?
\par }{\b\f28\fs16 Zinda:}{\f28\fs16  Sure. There's a bunch of cool new stuff that we're doing for HTML and XML editing.
\par For HTML editing, one of my favorites is a feature that allows you to lay out a 2-D region of controls, graphics, and HTML elements, hit a button, and the content is broken out into a table so that even downloadab
le browsers will be able to see it just as you laid it out. That's something that takes a lot of fine-tuning to do by hand, and we make it real easy. I think it will be a great editing feature.
\par In addition, in source view, we've added the ability to choose a target browser, and basic descriptions of HTML that you would like to write in. The program then does statement completion, color coding, and error flagging on the source that you\rquote
re writing. So if you forget an end tag or you type the wrong name for a tag, the program will flag it for you and will actually complete the tags for you. You can pick what version of HTML you\rquote
re writing -- or, in fact, you can come up with your own specific version, and we\rquote ll track to that in the editor.
\par In addition, we're
adding a great new XML editor that not only gives you the ability to edit in source, just like in the HTML editor, but will also complete the tags for you and let you plug in whatever schema you want. We also have a visual schema designer that lets you dr
ag out the elements and subelements that you want in your schema, and then flip to a data view. Then you enter the data into the XML file in a grid, without having to type in the tags. We think that's going to make designing and using XML really easy.

\par }{\b\f28\fs16 MSDN Online:}{\f28\fs16  Is this is all part of Web Forms?
\par }{\b\f28\fs16 Zinda:}{\f28\fs16  This is all part of visual basic.net.
\par }{\b\f28\fs16 MSDN Online:}{\f28\fs16  Getting back to Web Forms: It sounds like they are either very similar or even almost exactly like Visual Basic forms.
\par }{\b\f28\fs16 Zinda:}{\f28\fs16  Exactly. We think that people who have used Visual Basic forms are going to recognize the Web Forms technology immediately and be able to get started on it without hardly any learning curve.
\par }{\b\f28\fs16 MSDN Online:}{\f28\fs16  There aren't any gotchas that will trip up some Visual Basic developers?
\par }{\b\f28\fs16 Zinda:}{\f28\fs16  Ju
st the gotcha we talked about before, the fact that you now have a server between you and every event, or a slow connection between you and every event. And there are obviously some controls available to you now that you didn't have in Visual Basic forms.

\par }{\b\f28\fs16 MSDN Online:}{\f28\fs16  What about data binding? Does Web Forms relate to data binding in any way?
\par }{\b\f28\fs16 Zinda:}{\f28\fs16  Yes. We've got a lot of great data-binding features in Web Forms. First of all, we now have the ability to bind controls to any XML file. No matter where it came
 from, you can take your XML file and bind it to the controls you want.
\par Web Forms controls know how to manage their own state. When you bind your data to the control and send it to the client, the user changes the control. When it gets sent back, you can
access the value that they typed in simply by saying, textbox1.text. That will give you the value the user typed in -- and in fact, you'll get data-changed events for every field that they typed in. This makes building your classic data-entry or data-acce
ss application very simple. The kind of code you would have had to write in the past without this technology gets pretty gnarly.
\par }{\b\f28\fs16 MSDN Online:}{\f28\fs16  Are you going to ship any cool new controls with visual basic.net?
\par }{\b\f28\fs16 Zinda:}{\f28\fs16  Yeah, one o
f my favorites is a data grid that allows you to -- without writing a single line of code -- build a grid, fill it with data, and allow it to be sorted, edited, and have rows added to it, simply by dragging out the grid and binding it to the data source y
ou want, whether it's an XML file or a SQL database.
\par }{\b\f28\fs16 MSDN Online:}{\f28\fs16  If you look at all the different features of Web Forms, what is your personal favorite?
\par }{\b\f28\fs16 Zinda:}{\f28\fs16  I'd have to say my favorite is that fact that the Web Forms controls actually have an event mode
l that you can program against, so that you don't have to look at odd names in the request header to find out what happened on your page. They also manage their state. Those are my two favorite features.
\par }{\b\f28\fs16 MSDN Online:}{\f28\fs16  Will Web Forms provide a way for third-party developers to build new controls that plug into this framework?
\par }{\b\f28\fs16 Zinda:}{\f28\fs16  Yeah, absolutely. We've put a bunch of work into making sure it's really easy to build Web Forms controls. In fact, we expect it's going to be about as easy to build a new Web For
ms control as it was to build a user control in Visual Basic 6.0.
\par We think ISVs are going to end up building Web Forms controls with special functionality, different kinds of controls like grids or outline controls. We also think developers are going to e
nd up building their own specialized controls for their own applications, such as a special kind of navigation bar that they reuse in a lot of their apps.
\par }{\b\f28\fs16 MSDN Online:}{\f28\fs16  So you predict that a lot of third-party Web Forms controls will be released that developers will be able to buy and plug into their own apps?
\par }{\b\f28\fs16 Zinda:}{\f28\fs16  Exactly. Much like ActiveX controls today in Visual Basic, you'll be able to get the control, add it to your tool box, and just start using it on your own Web Forms, in the applications you build.
\par }{\b\f28\fs16 MSDN Online:}{\f28\fs16  To summarize, what do you want developers to remember about Web Forms?
\par }{\b\f28\fs16 Zinda:}{\f28\fs16  The things I think are most important about Web Forms are, first of all, they're going to be very easy to use. They'll be much easier to use than the
 technologies that exist today for building Web pages. They'll make it very easy for Visual Basic developers to get up and running in building these new types of applications for the Web.
\par In addition, I think the performance and the scalability work that we've done on ASP.NET and ASP.NET Web Forms will be a boon to developers who are already using ASP technology. We\rquote
ve spent an enormous amount of time making sure this is going to be a key aspect of building applications on the }{\f1\fs18 Microsoft web solutions platform}{\f28\fs16 .
\par }{\b\f28\fs16 MSDN Online:}{\f28\fs16
 With this next release of Visual Basic with Web Forms and these other new technologies, do you think that its going to change developers perception of Visual Basic itself as a tool primarily for building Web sites and not just Windows applications?

\par }{\b\f28\fs16 Zinda:}{\f28\fs16  I think that it's just going to grow what people think of as the domain of Visual Basic. I mean, it will still be a great platform for building what are basically Visual Basic applications, but what we\rquote
re recognizing is that the kind of applications that people want to build today have grown into Web applications, and that's what we spent a lot of energy on in visual basic.net.
\par }{\b\f28\fs16 MSDN Online:}{\f28\fs16  Are these Web applications "tied to the Microsoft platform" or to the Windows platform?
\par }{\b\f28\fs16 Zinda:}{\f28\fs16  Not at all. All
of the technologies we've put into visual basic.net are built on top of open standards. Web Forms controls are really about using HTTP and HTML to render the UI for your application. Web services are built on top of SOAP. The data access that you can use
in Web Forms in visual basic.net are built on top of XML.
\par We've tried to build a platform that uses open standards and interoperates with basically any platform that talks an open standard.
