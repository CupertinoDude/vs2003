      <span class="header">What is Windows Forms?</span>
      <P>Windows Forms is a framework for building Windows client applications
      that utilize the common language runtime. Windows Forms applications can be written in
      any language that the common language runtime supports. Some of the advantages of
      using Windows Forms include the following:</P>

<ul>
  <li><B>Simplicity and power: </B>Windows Forms is a programming model for
      developing Windows applications that combines the simplicity of the Visual
      Basic 6.0 programming model with the power and flexibility of the common
      language runtime.</P>
  <li><B>Lower total cost of ownership: </B>Windows Forms takes advantage of the versioning and
      deployment features of the common language runtime to offer reduced deployment
      costs and higher application robustness over time. This significantly lowers the
      maintenance costs (TCO) for applications
      written in Windows Forms.</P>
  <li><B>Architecture for controls: </B>Windows Forms offers an architecture for
      controls and control containers that is based on concrete implementation of the
      control and container classes. This significantly reduces
      control-container interoperability issues.</P>
  <li><B>Security: </B>Windows Forms takes full advantage of the security features
      of the common language runtime. This means that Windows Forms can be used implement
      everything from an untrusted control running in the browser to a fully
      trusted application installed on a user's hard disk.</P>
  <li><B>XML Web services support: </B>Windows Forms offers full support for quickly
      and easily connecting to XML Web services.</P>
  <li><B>Rich graphics: </B>Windows Forms is one of the first ship vehicles for
      GDI+, a new version of the Windows Graphical Device Interface (GDI) that
      supports alpha blending, texture brushes, advanced transforms, rich text
      support, and more.</P>
  <li><B>Flexible controls: </B>Windows Forms offers a rich set of controls that encompass
      all of the controls offered by Windows. These controls also offer new features, such as
      &quot;flat look" styles for buttons, radio buttons, and check boxes.  Refer
      to <a href="/quickstart/winforms/doc/WinFormsSamples.aspx"
      style="color:darkred">Control Samples </A>for the complete list of
      controls.  </P>
  <li><B>Data awareness: </B>Windows Forms offers full support for the ADO.NET data
      model.</P>
  <li><B>ActiveX control support: </B>Windows Forms offers full support for ActiveX
      controls. You can easily host ActiveX controls in a Windows Forms application.
      You can also host a Windows Forms control as an ActiveX control. </P>
  <li><B>Licensing: </B>Windows Forms takes advantage of the common language runtime
      enhanced licensing model. </P>
  <li><P><B>Printing: </B>Windows Forms offers a printing framework that enables
      applications to provide comprehensive reports.</P>
  <li><B>Accessibility: </B>Windows Forms controls implement the interfaces
      defined by Microsoft Active Accessibility (MSAA), which make it simple
      to build applications that support accessibility aids, such as screen
      readers.</P>
  <li><B>Design-time support: </B>Windows Forms takes full advantage of the meta-data
      and component model features offered by the common language runtime to provide
      thorough design-time support for both control users and control implementers.</P>
</ul>
