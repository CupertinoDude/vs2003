Windows Forms. The QuickStart samples are designed to be short, 
easy-to-understand illustrations of many of the features of Windows Forms.

QuickStart?</span> <br>The Windows Forms QuickStart assumes that you are 
familiar with object-oriented programming techniques.  It also assumes 
that you are familiar with concepts such as windows, controls, menus, and 
so on.  You should have experience building applications using Microsoft

environment.  If you have experience building applications using the Windows 
Win32 API, the MFC, or the Visual Basic forms package, then you can quickly learn Windows Forms.</p>
